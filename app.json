Maike spent many Saturdays in the Appsterdam MeetUp as a newbie, to leading it, which she continues to this day. It was in Appsterdam that Maike connected with and developed mad respect for developers. She loves to be with them, whether it be to talk tech or life.\r\nIt is her great joy to be able to support passionate developers, whether it is in finding jobs or just catching up and learn about development!"
