It\u2019s about creating side by side, with minimal structure and maximum accessibility.\nWe can learn and inspire each other.\n\nWhether you want to work on your side project, procrastinate your side project with a new side project, or learn a new skill, or just drink coffee - you're welcome to drop by anytime during 10-18h for as long or short as you want.\n\nThe event is intended to cross-pollination between different disciplines, spark fresh ideas, and inspire participants to explore skills outside their comfort zone.\nEveryone is welcome, regardless of background or experience.","price":"0","location_name":"001 Commandantswoning | Marineterrein","location_address":"Kattenburgerstraat 5, Amsterdam","icon":"https:\/\/secure.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/6\/3\/4\/highres_518678452.jpeg","attendees":"61","latitude":"0","longitude":"0"},{"id":"bcqfqtyjcdbhc","organizer":"Wesley de Groot","date":"20260225190000:20260225220000","name":"Weekly Meeten en Drinken","description":"Ahoy, fellow Appsterdammers!\nIf you feel like it's time to start slowly getting used to being social again, maybe you'd like to warm up with your fellow makers, nerds, and other technology enthusiasts, who might better understand your specific interests and social style.\nJoin us in the cozy cafe where Appsterdam was born, at an earlier than usual time, to enjoy their legendary terrace and its ongoing attempts to comply with an ever-shifting landscape of rules \u2014 something many App Makers will understand!\nYes, even after ten long years and a pandemic, this is still the place for you to meet your fellow Appsterdammers, get to know members of the community, meet a potential business partner, bring your app to share with others, exchange ideas with like-minded people...
