You've probably built UI and made API calls before, so how is this best done in Flutter?\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss the motivations for using Flutter over its competitors. We'll show what the developer needs to know about how it works. Then there will be a step by step coding walk-through, which shows how to avoid common mistakes.\r\n\r\nBy the end, you'll have a full understanding of how one codebase can be written for an excellent user experience on all platforms, along with best practices for state management and networking. You'll also have access to the codebase of the performant sample app we'll create. You'll have what's needed to build Flutter projects elegantly.",

No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.\n\nBe sure to ask the waitress\/waiter about their seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. All Appsterdammers get *10% off*\u00a0*the entire bill*, so order whatever you want to eat\/drink.\u00a0Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.\n\nThe time is always **Wednesday at 19:00**. The place is always **[Caf\u00e9 Bax](http:\/\/www.cafebax.nl\/)**.\n\n*Please note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly at 19:00. So don't fear, you can *always* find Appsterdammers at this event! Not sure you're in the right place? Just ask the waiters!*\n\n",

During this special Appsterdam Business Chat we'll be speaking to Stephen Donnelly who works for Spectral - a tech development and system integration company in the smart energy domain, based in Amsterdam. As well as covering the role of software and data in the energy transition, this session will cover aspects of Spectral's current software offering which includes: energy management systems, energy portfolio management tools and platforms for smart communities and blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading. There will be a particular focus on the latter which has been implemented at De Ceuvel as a blockchain token called the Jouliette; in the longer term, Spectral's goal is to create a platform for prosumers, microgrids, industry stakeholders (including DSOs and TSOs) and larger-scale renewable generation to exchange energy, flexibility and other data-driven services using a blockchain-based approach.\n\nWatch Spectral's CEO Philip Gladek talk about their revolutionary Blockchain solution here: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/MOysMUoa-20](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MOysMUoa-20)\n\nStephen is the CIO at Spectral. Stephen has more than 20 years' experience of technology deployments across multiple roles from software development to process consultancy and project management. He holds a Masters in Engineering and Computer Science from Oxford University.\n\n--------\n\nOne thing I have learned talking to people around the world is that lack of VC funding is never the problem.

                "description": "Over the years, Appsterdam has organized many tech-events to tackle important issues for many industries like energy, mobility, tourism and more - but when it comes to Hackathons, most of have \"been there, and done that\". In 2018, do these \"purposeful hackathons\" have any impact on the industry we try to change? For this special Business Chat we'll speak with Anne Bruinsma and learn about the important work she is doing at FarmHack.NL - organizer of tech events to tackle urgent issues from over-fishing to sustainable farming. This will be very informal but interactive session where we will explore the past, present and future of hackathons, and how they can still influence industries. We invite coders, designers, business developers to join us on Wednesday to help re-imagine the hackathon. Bring your own experiences and ideas for the ideal Future Hackathon (and I'll bring the donuts!)\n\n-----\n\nOne thing I have learned talking to people around the world is that lack of VC funding is never the problem. The problem is that people think about business the wrong way.\n\nAppsterdam Business Chat is your chance to get advice about whatever it is you're trying to do from someone who knows how to do things.\n\nAppsterdam provides coffee and tea, and snacks, typically donuts. If you have special requests or suggestions, let us know in the comments.\n\nIf you would like to make a day of it, you are welcome to bring your laptop and sit in our free workspace provided by A Lab, then join us in the evening for dinner and drinks at Cafe Bax.\n\nEveryone is welcome regardless of technical knowledge.\n\n12:30 Welcome! Doors open\n\n13:00 Introductions\n\n14:30 Room closes, invited to work in our workspace.\n\n19:00 Meeten en Drinken at Cafe Bax, Ten Katestraat 119\n\n",

And you even got your management to give you the \"OK, Go\" to start spending time on that change. You have all that you wanted! Don't you?\n\nEven though, you do understand how to create a clean architecture mobile app from scratch, soon enough you find out that you need a good approach to take your app from its current state to a well architected app. Your business needs to keep adding features. And your Objective-C code wants to be migrated to Swift. But you cannot afford (should not either) take the Big Bang approach: rewrite your code from scratch.\n\nIn this talk I will share some strategies, tricks, and gotchas about how to do the migration to an advanced architecture mobile app (mostly based on the clean architecture). I will cover strategies and tactics. And I will use an open source app as to show how to apply some of those changes to an already existing app.\n\nI decided to prepare this talk, because this is the most often asked question when I do my workshop on hands on clean architecture for iOS.\n\n*Presentation will be 60 minutes, with 30 minutes for questions.*\n\n12:30 Welcome!

You can bring your PI, Arduino and sensors... Join us for the\u00a0[Triggi](https:\/\/triggi.com\/)\u00a0Discovery Day, a hands-on day to learn about Triggi Connect.\n\nKeep an eye on this page as more info may follow!\n\n**What is Triggi?**\n\nTriggi is a free app for iOS and Android and it allows you to connect a growing list of smart devices, apps and services to each other. According to rules you have defined, Triggi makes things smarter. You can now add your devices to the mix!\u00a0\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gEhNtVXNEhY](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gEhNtVXNEhY)\n\nCurrently, Triggi works with:\n\n\u2022 Philips Hue Lighting\n\n\u2022\u00a0Nest Thermostat\n\n\u2022\u00a0Netatmo Weatherstation and Thermostat\n\n\u2022\u00a0Toon Thermostat\n\n\u2022\u00a0Weather information provided by Foreca\n\n\u2022\u00a0Dutch EV charging stations, provided by [oplaadpalen.nl](http:\/\/oplaadpalen.nl\/)\n\n\u2022\u00a0Location information (GPS on smartphone)\n\n\u2022\u00a0Date and time\n\n\u2022\u00a0Sunset and sunrise\n\n\u2022\u00a0Smartphone notification\n\n\u2022\u00a0Twitter\n\n\u2022\u00a0Facebook\n\nYou can find Triggi on both the [iOS appstore](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/apple-store\/id1125535051?pt=117972703&ct=TriggiDiscoveryDay&mt=8) and the [Google Play store](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.triggi.triggi).\n\n**Hands on Triggi Connect**\n\nWe'll kick off with an introduction to Triggi Connect, a 'maker channel' to facilitate makers and developers, enthousiasts, advanced users to quickly connect new stuff to Triggi, without having to develop a new channel first. Triggi Connect can be used for experiments, pilots or more permanent applications that do not justify a channel to be developed and\/or maintained. With Triggi Connect, developers AND users alike can create 'triggs' containing both actions and conditions to interface with (yet) unsupported external hardware or -services.\n\n**Examples**\n\nOn this day in Alab, demo material and smart devices will be available, as well as two examples on Github:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Motion Sensor - With a PIR and Arduino WiFi shield and you can detect and report movement. You can use that as a condition to trigger an action with Triggi\n\n\u2022\u00a0Sound Sensor - as above, based on sound level.\n\nIf the noise exceeds a specific level, a signal will be sent to Triggi Connect and you can connect it to an action.\n\nThrough Triggi Connect you can subscribe to events. While you can use the sound sensor to start blinking lights if the noise exceeds 60 dB, another Triggi user can access that condition for something else, for example to send an email and write the value in a Google sheet.\n\n**So, bring along your laptop, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, sensors or any other devices you would like to connect to Triggi**.\u00a0\n\nTriggi developers will be present to help you out with any questions you might have on Triggi and how to connect different devices to each other.\n\n",

The goal of this session is to create visualizations using a new tool that is developed at the University of Virginia called VisualEyes. VisualEyes is an HTML5 web-based authoring tool to weave images, maps, charts, video and data into highly interactive and compelling dynamic visualizations. See some examples\u00a0[here](http:\/\/www.viseyes.org\/viseyes.htm).\n\n**Additional tools**\n\nOn [viseyes.org](http:\/\/viseyes.org\/) you will find other great tools that you can use:\n\n[SHIVA](http:\/\/www.viseyes.org\/shiva\/): fast and easy creation visualizations in HTML (use with Visualeyes!).\n\n[Qmedia](http:\/\/www.qmediaplayer.com\/): create interactive videos.\n\n**Sample data sets**\n\nTogether with the folks of\u00a0[data.amsterdam.nl](http:\/\/data.amsterdam.nl\/)\u00a0we have prepared a couple of data sets you may use. As most files are in CVS formats we have created Excel versions to save you time. Where needed we added a column for GPS locations that you can use straight away.\n\nSource:\u00a0[http:\/\/maps.amsterdam.nl\/open_geodata\/](http:\/\/maps.amsterdam.nl\/open_geodata\/)\n\nIn the Excel files data filtering is enabled (pull down arrows in header row). You can use those to find a usable subset for Visualeyes. Example: some records in the data sets have links to pictures. Filter on \"nonblanks\" to only display entries what have a picture....\n\nTip: as the bottom of the filter menu you see normally see \"show blanks\" and \"show nonblanks\". Some times scrolling down takes a long time. Then create a custom filer (at the top of the menu): select \"does not equal to\" and leave the field empty. That works the same.\n\nIn [this Excel file](http:\/\/files.camerize.com\/datahack\/visualeyes_column_calculations.xlsx) you will find examples of how to derive Visualize columns from other data columns. Select \"show comments\" for details.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*THE HISTORY OF TRAFFIC LIGHTS*\n\nTraffic lights, [info and example](http:\/\/maps.amsterdam.nl\/verkeerslichten\/?LANG=en)\n\n\u2022 [CVS file](http:\/\/files.camerize.com\/datahack\/verkeerslichten\/VERKEERSLICHTEN.csv)\n\n\u2022 [Excel file](http:\/\/files.camerize.com\/datahack\/verkeerslichten\/VERKEERSLICHTEN.xlsx)\u00a0\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*PUBLIC SPACE REPORTS (complaints\/queries\/reports of citizens)\n\n*New and outstanding reports are public.

Bring something to share, and we'll provide the bread.\n\nIf you would like to make a day of it, you are welcome to bring your laptop and sit in our free workspace provided by A Lab, then join us for evening drinks at Cafe Bax.\n\nEveryone is welcome regardless of technical skill.

By doing this, the teams generate APIs that can be valuable for developing new apps for the city.\u00a0\n\nJohan Groenen (developer) will talk about their approach and about DataPunt, the cities infrastructure for storing and retrieving city data.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are rebooting for the new year with a new format and a new host: Appsterdam\u2019s own Mayor Mike Lee.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve welcomed international guest speakers and local App Makers alike to take the stage and share their knowledge on a host of technical and non-technical topics including computer languages, modeling, testing, design, marketing, business, philosophy,\u00a0startups, strategy, and more.\n\nNew for 2015, we\u2019re adding more variety to the program, with a short talk from Mike, a live or pre-recorded lecture, group discussion, and an open stage where you can share what great things you\u2019ve been working on.\n\nAs before, we\u2019ll share lunch together. We\u2019ll provide bread and drinks. Bring your own\u00a0sandwich topping to share with others.\n\nYou will be welcome to work or hang out in the Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day and then join us for meeten and drinken in the evening.

First, you have an idea and then you start building it.\u00a0 The next step is to develop your app further and grow audience. However, in order to do so, first you need to get other basics straight and question yourself:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Why did you start this?\n\n\u2022\u00a0What value does your app add?\n\n\u2022\u00a0Do people even need it, or how can you make them need it?\n\nWhen you have a great idea it can be tempting to stick on it, build your tool further based on thoughts and assumptions, or based on feedback from friends. Nevertheless you want to avoid building an app that won\u2019t be used. So in this lecture we will discuss Basic Business Rules of developing your app. Topics that will be covered slightly:\n\n\u2022\u00a0How to get the right feedback\n\n\u2022\u00a0How to add value with your app\n\n\u2022\u00a0How to operate in the market\n\n\u2022\u00a0Case examples\n\n--\n\nAs always, we\u2019ll share lunch together. We\u2019ll provide bread and drinks. Bring your own\u00a0sandwich topping to share with others.\n\nYou will be welcome to work or hang out in the Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day and then join us for meeten and drinken in the evening.

Different weeks, we'll focus on different things.\u00a0\n\nThe second week of the month is Pitch Club, where everyone gives a 60-second elevator pitch, and gets feedback on their technique, and the subtle art of pitching.\n\nOther weeks we'll do speaker training, live or pre-recorded lectures, or an open stage where we can see each other's work and share feedback.\n\nMaybe you have a great idea for something we could do together? Appsterdam is a self-sustaining community, so by all means, bring your ideas along with your natural curiosity.\n\nAs before, we\u2019ll share lunch together. We\u2019ll provide the bread. Bring your own\u00a0sandwich toppings or snacks to share with others.\n\nYou are also welcome to make Wednesday Appsterdam Day by working or hanging out in the adjacent Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day, then joining us at Cafe Bax for Meeten and Drinken in the evening.\u00a0\n\n12:30 Welcome! Doors open and lunch\n\n13:00 Kick-off\n\n14:00 Program ends\n\n14:30 Meeting room closes, invited to work in our workspace.\n\n19:00 Meeten en Drinken at Cafe Bax, Ten Katestraat 119\n\n",

For many app developers, it appears to be the latter, with branding and marketing seen as a way to introduce a product to the market once it\u2019s finished. Branding and storytelling specialist, Terence Barry, sees it differently:*\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a great believer that nothing should be begun until you have worked out its story - what it will \u2018mean\u2019 to a certain target audience. A product should be shaped to best serve the story that will sell it, not the other way around.\u201d*\u00a0On\u00a0July 22nd, Terence will present a 1-hour keynote in support of his theory, using examples from Hollywood and other mass media to show how the products with the best narrative(s) always win out.\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/1\/f\/a\/c\/600_439568108.jpeg\" \/>\n\n*Terence Barry\u00a0began his career with BMW Group, helping create the stories that built the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands, before being headhunted to\u00a0do the same for Bentley in the United States.\u00a0A stint in Formula One was then followed by a career shift, where Terence decided to investigate the world of story more deeply, traveling to story festivals all\u00a0over the world and working in Hollywood.\u00a0This new knowledge allowed him to find the \u2018DNA\u2019 that exists at the heart of all great stories and to see an opportunity to bring this skill to the corporate world through his company, [BRAND-and-STORY](http:\/\/www.brand-and-story.com).*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures are rebooting for the new year with a new format and a new host: Appsterdam\u2019s own Mayor Mike Lee.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve welcomed international guest speakers and local App Makers alike to take the stage and share their knowledge on a host of technical and non-technical topics including computer languages, modeling, testing, design, marketing, business, philosophy,\u00a0startups, strategy, and more.\n\nNew for 2015, we\u2019re adding more variety to the program, with a short talk from Mike, a live or pre-recorded lecture, group discussion, and an open stage where you can share what great things you\u2019ve been working on.\n\nAs before, we\u2019ll share lunch together.

They range from community volunteering apps to apps for locating environmentally friendly products. Examples include: OWise, Heppee and our member Konnektid is building one. That is not to suggest that social ventures should be creating their own apps just because everyone else is.\n\nSo what are good reasons to build an app. When actually should you? And if you realise that the problem you\u2019re trying to solve is best solved via a mobile app, how do you go about it? Who to work with and what is the minimum investment you need?

Free traveling and hotel accommodation offered for freelance app developers, students, and members of non-profit organizations! (See terms and conditions below.)\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**TNW2015 Hackathon**\n\nEvery year The Next Web hosts a prestigious hack battle during [TNW Conference](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/conference\/europe\/). For 36 hours an exclusive group of international coders, some of the world's leading platforms and experts needed to build amazing hacks join forces in two days of coding, networking and learning from the API partners.\u00a0\n\nTogether with [NLnetLabs](http:\/\/nlnetlabs.nl\/) and [VeriSign](https:\/\/www.verisigninc.com\/en_US\/innovation\/verisign-labs\/index.xhtml) we are looking for enthusiastic developers, to develop an app using the [getdns API](https:\/\/getdnsapi.net\/). With getdns you can resolve IP addresses yourself without relying on your provider or the Google Name server (to mention something). You can do a security check with DNSSEC and receive a certificate that you can use to set up an encrypted connection between your app and the service. Nobody can see what is going over the connection; this is how you create a spoofing resistant solution.\n\nDuring the 2015 TNW Hack Battle, we challenge you to build privacy enhancing new apps with [getdns api](https:\/\/getdnsapi.net\/). Participating in the Hackathon goes by invitation and we have spots for 8 candidates. Your journey starts here. To win your spot: RSVP on on this meetup page\u00a0before Friday April 10!\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**Program**\n\nThe [TNW Hack Battle](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/conference\/europe\/hack-battle)\u00a0is on April 22 and 23, from 8:00 to 18:00. You may continue in the evening and night :-)\u00a0For Verisign, **RSVP on this page**!\n\n*Wednesday April 22*\n\n\u2022\u00a0kick-off and presentations of the API partners (Verisign, Dropbox, Spotify, Facebook\u2026) For Verisign **RSVP on this page**!\n\n\u2022\u00a01 1\/2 of programming using the sponsored API, getdns in this case.\n\n*Thursday April 23*\n\n\u2022\u00a0In the afternoon: 5 minute presentations of the results.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Award by the API partners for their group.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Overall award by the TNW jury\u00a0\n\nThe TNW2015 conference is on April 23 and 24, Thursday and Friday. So when done you can enjoy a full conference day for free!\n\n**About getdns**\n\nUsing the Internet is like sending picture postcards: everybody can read what you write on the back, including the postman. It is also like taking your shower in public without a curtain. Most apps expose you to surveillance; only a few apps provide methods to make your communications more private. So, close the shower curtain, stop using postcards: help users to be less exposed when they send Internet traffic to each other and innovate with DANE, the newest addition to the domain name system. The open source [getdns api](https:\/\/getdnsapi.net)\u00a0was designed to enable all kinds of applications to build innovative security services. The [getdns api](https:\/\/getdnsapi.net) provides easy access to the global security infrastructure that is the promise of the DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) and DANE.\n\n**Challenge Examples**\u00a0\n\nHere are two challenge examples, or design your own:\n\nUse getdnsapi in conjunction with an application API, such as Paypal's, fetch with DANE a public key of the person you are contacting (e.g. paying) with the API, and encrypt the messages that will be sent to her or him so that only he\/she can read it. The UI should let your users know they've been protected this way.\u00a0\n\nUse getdnsapi within an open source XMPP (jabber) client - fetch with DANE the public keys of the IM peers and increase their personal privacy. The jabber client UI should let the users know about their extra privacy. We have set up supporting infrastructure providing securely delegated domains for each participant and means to provision S\/MIME certificates and PGP keys.\u00a0\n\nHave a look at our [python, java, nodejs and C examples](https:\/\/getdnsapi.net\/) to get started.\n\n**Terms and conditions**\n\nTravel expenses reimbursed for freelance app developers, students, and employees of non-profit organizations within Europe and The Netherlands (if living outside Amsterdam).\u00a0\n\nThis an application round, by signing up you have to opportunity to win a spot at the hackathon. VeriSign selects the candidates with a maximum of 8. In order to make their decision you may be contacted by NLnetLabs or VeriSign.\n\n",

That\u2019s the best way to welcome the announcement of the new WebKit in\u00a0iOS8. Since the first version of iOS web developers have been struggling with the\u00a0scarce possibilities of UIWebView. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Safari\u201d was a common complaint. That\u00a0time is now over and your wishes have come true. In this presentation we will learn\u00a0about the many new possibilities enabled by the new WebKit framework. In particular\u00a0we will focus on the bridge between native code and web content.\n\nAbout our guest speaker:\n\nCesare is a speaker, writer, UX designer and developer specializing in web and mobile\u00a0applications. He began working on interactive applications while he was a researcher\u00a0in the academia. He runs [Studio Magnolia](http:\/\/www.studiomagnolia.com), an interactive studio that creates\u00a0compelling web and mobile applications. He likes to brag about the fact that Lisp was the first programming language he learned. When off-duty Cesare spends time with his wife raising two lively kids. He enjoys playing beach tennis and snowboarding (but not at the same time).\u00a0\n\nAs before, we\u2019ll share lunch together. We\u2019ll provide bread and drinks. Bring your own\u00a0sandwich topping to share with others.\n\nYou will be welcome to work or hang out in the Appsterdam workspace for the rest of day and then join us for meeten and drinken in the evening. From now on, Wednesday is Appsterdam day!!\u00a0\n\n12:30 Welcome!

This is the second of three workshops that match ideas to actual app makers.\n\nOur second session entitled **\u201cI\u2019ve developed my idea, now what?\u201d** we will be tackling the importance of \u201ccommunication\u201d in two parts. Part One is prototyping where participants are asked to develop simple interactive mockups to share with peers for feedback. Part 2 are mini workshops in funding. We will be talking to a few local heros in crowd funding and accelerator programs how to get from idea to market.\u00a0\n\nHomework: Prepare references of similar apps or apps that inspire you. Sketch out 5 screens using Screen Template.\n\n**Agenda:**\u00a0\n\n12:30-13:30 lunch\n\n13:30-13:45 Intro\n\n13:45-15:00 \u00a0\u201cQuick and Dirty Prototyping\u201d.

Using free-online tools you will sketch and make 5 screens interactive so you can explain your killer app idea to others.\u00a0\n\n**\u201cCrash Course Crowdfunding\"\u00a0**\n\nIn this Crash Course Crowdfunding we wil focus on the why and how of accelerating your projects through the crowd, taking you through the 9 basic principles derived from preparation, story and connection.\n\nThere are multiple goals that can be achieved through the crowd: not only funding but also market validation, a big launch and building and activating a community to name a few. Moving crowds has three main components: excellent preparation, a damn good story and passionately seeking connection.\u00a0Your strategy should be developed around them.\u00a0\n\nKarim Maarek, founder of Teach to Fish, is a crowdfunding and crowdcampaigning specialist.\u00a0He has developed numerous training and acceleration programs and is especially interested in scaling sustainable and creative ventures, via the crowd. Karim firmly believes that crowdfunding and crowd principles should be applied to any enterprise whatsoever.\u00a0\n\nIn the 18 months since its founding, Teach to Fish has aided clients in raising over half a million euros in funding.\u00a0The intensive, step-by-step Crowd Acceleration Program is the flagship product of Teach to Fish.\n\n**\u201cAccelerators and Incubators\u201d**\n\nCralan Deutsch of LeadBoxer will share insights gained from a ride in the Rockstart Accelerator.\u00a0Leadboxer was one of 10 start-ups selected out of 500 for the 2014 Web-Mobile program.\n\nBy the end of the session you\u2019ll have an idea of what an accelerator a) means in practice and b) can offer you. It\u2019s a general session, no specific knowledge required, familiarity with Lean methodology would be helpful.\u00a0Cralan \/ LeadBoxer & Opentracker have been building\/ supporting SaaS for 10 years, including an app tracking on the Apple platform.\u00a0\n\nOur company specialises in (big data) analysis of website\/ app user engagement, and identification of company (lead) traffic.\n\nCralan likes to ride his bakfiets around amsterdam.\n\n",

This first session geared to validate your app idea thru the lenses of market, business model, financial and technical resources. The aim here is to field-test your idea with peers while introducing you to the realities of app making.\u00a0\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n12:30-13:30 Lunch\n\n13:30-13:45 Introduction\n\n13:45-14:30 \u00a0\u201cThe Gap Between Idea and App\u201d\n\n14:30-15:30 \u201cPitch Makes Perfect\"\n\n15:30-17:00 \u201cBuilding A Business Model For Your App\"\u00a0\n\n17:00-18:00 Beer & pizza!\n\n*\u201cThe Gap Between Idea and App\u201d*\n\nSo you want to have an app. But what is an app? Apps are those handy little icons on your phone, that do something very simple but very useful when you tap them. How hard can it be? In this interactive session, Marion explains why it's a bit harder than that (and expensive!) to get an app idea realized.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cPitch Makes Perfect\u201d*\n\nTom van Arman from Tapp will introduce participants to the fundamentals of the app \u201cPitch Deck\u201d. Ideas are a dime a dozen, execution is all that matters. Executing a successful app depends on how well you pitch your concept or sell your idea to your audience \/ potential users. Participants will have 30 seconds to field test their ideas by pitching to peers and receiving their crucial feedback.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBuilding A Business Model For Your App\u201d\n\nDani\u00ebl Horn from KPMG will be introducing participants to the crucial role of the \u201cBusiness Model\u201d when developing apps. During this talk we will walk through business models that work and through those that fail for applications. We will use the business model canvas as a take-off point but quickly go into what it takes to build an app with a business model. Check it out: [http:\/\/www.businessmodelgeneration.com\/canvas\/bmc](http:\/\/www.businessmodelgeneration.com\/canvas\/bmc)\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos2.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/d\/6\/5\/8\/600_416874872.jpeg\" \/>\n\n**About Marion de Groot:\u00a0**\n\nMarion is a freelance requirements analyst, bridging the gap between ideas and IT. She translates the requirements and wishes of the customer who wants the software (apps, web or desktop) into clear and realistic specifications for the developers.\u00a0\n\n**About Tom van Arman:\u00a0**\n\nTom is a award winning app developer dedicated to making real apps to solve real world problems. Over the last 4 years he has been helping customers, agencies and governments design and deliver high impact apps to the market.\u00a0\n\n**About Dani\u00ebl Horn\u00a0**\n\nDani\u00ebl is founding member of the Early Stage Technology Group (EST) of KPMG in the Netherlands. The goal of the group is to help enterprises to innovate in close collaboration with start-ups, bridging the gap between start-ups and the enterprise. Dani\u00ebl has a background in IT strategy consulting and led the fund raising for tech start-ups (mostly apps) for two years before joining KPMG.\u00a0\n\n**MORE TO COME:**\n\nWe will soon be announcing future dates for Part 2: PROTOTYPING \u201cI\u2019ve developed my idea, now what\u201d, and Part 3: DEVELOPING \u201cI\u2019m ready program, now what\u201d.\u00a0\n\nStay tuned!\n\n",

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nSamuel Goodwin from Roundwall Software, Ash Furrow from Artsy and Marga Keuvelaar from Black Pixel will introduce you to iOS programming with Swift in the way programmers learn best: through hands-on practical exercises. By the end of the session, you'll have a grasp of the UI coding, connecting to network resources, and the Xcode IDE... and most important, the skeleton of your first application. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n11:00-11:30: Doors open, environment check.\n\n11:00-12:30: Swift exercises (in case you didn't read the tutorial)\n\n12:30-13:30: Lunch break\n\n13:30-17:00: iOS training and hands-on exercises!\n\n17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer\n\nThis session is targeted at developers who haven't yet learned iOS programming, or haven't yet flexed their muscles with it.\u00a0\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\nYour Mac with Xcode 6.0 installed, which can be installed from the App Store.\u00a0\n\n**Speakers Bios:\n\n** Samuel has been developing software for Apple platforms since 2007. He has worked as a freelancer as well as developing in-house software for a NYC startup.

                "description": "**Roberto Valenti**, CTO at Sightcorp, will talk about **Human Centered Applications**.\n\n\"Touch interfaces have revolutionized the way we perceive and use smartphones and computers. The rise of this new interaction paradigm made it possible to create highly functional applications, while maintaining basic and simple interfaces. This is referred to as a \"natural user interface\", which allows interacting with on-screen content using both direct manipulations and gestures. Interacting with these applications is more natural than using the previous keyboard-and-mouse paradigm.\n\nHowever, humans interact using many more information channels, for instance voice, body language and facial expressions. The current natural user interfaces are largely unaware of the interacting user.\n\nIn this talk, I argue that applications should detect and use information about their users, ranging from their age and gender, to their mood and attention. I will explain how important it is to read, understand, and use this untapped source of information to bootstrap the next evolution in Human-Computer Interaction: Human-Centered Applications.\"\n\n**Speaker's bio:**\n\nDr. Roberto Valenti is the Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Sightcorp, a joint venture with the University of Amsterdam focused on the automatic analysis of faces. After graduating with high honors in Artificial Intelligence, he completed his doctorate in machine vision at the Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam at the University of Amsterdam, where he currently holds a position of researcher. During his doctorate he achieved a record number of high-impact scientific publications in the field of automated human behavior analysis, face analysis and human-computer interaction. His research mainly focuses on sensing and understanding user\u2019s actions, intentions and interests by solely using off-the-shelves hardware.\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

                "description": "**We are excited to announce a special hackathon along with Salesforce during the Salesforce1 World Tour in the RAI conference center!**\n\nCome join us on May 27 for a day of ideas, coding, and designing for the future of social welfare and health in the Netherlands! The challenge is explained below, and there are 1,750 Euros in prizes (cash) for the winners!\n\n[Salesforce1 API](https:\/\/developer.salesforce.com\/docs\/atlas.en-us.salesforce1api.meta\/salesforce1api\/apis_overview.htm) experts will be on-hand to answer questions about the platform.\u00a0 Click\u00a0[here](https:\/\/developer.salesforce.com\/docs\/atlas.en-us.salesforce1api.meta\/salesforce1api\/apis_overview.htm)\u00a0for more information on the Salesforce1 platform.\n\nThe event will be covered through a live webcast by the Top Names team, on [fastmovingtargets.nl](http:\/\/fastmovingtargets.nl) and on the Appsterdam Facebook page. As a participant, you can be on the show to present your own product, company or activity. Your Keynotes, Powerpoints, movies, desktop and device screens can be shared live. This is a great opportunity to get exposure!\n\nRSVP here to reserve your spot. Everybody in the app business, coders, designers, marketers\u2026 you are all welcome to attend. Registration is free, there are no charges to participate in the hackathon!\n\nFor more details see: [Official Rules and Regulations](http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appsterdam\/pages\/27-5-14_Hackathon_Official_Rules_and_Regulations\/). By registering you\u00a0agree to these Official Rules and Regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen registering, you'll need to enter some contact details, as we will get you a Salesforce1 badge that will give you access to the conference. You also can describe your product or activity in case you would like to be on the webcast.\n\n**Schedule**\n\n8:30: Registration and welcome refreshments\n\n9:00-9:30: Introduction, overview of Salesforce1 development platform and API\n\n9:30-11:00 Pitches, idea selection, and team formation\n\n11:30-16:30: Hacking and prototype building (with lunch, drinks, and snacks provided)\n\n16:30-18:00: Final presentations and judging!\n\n**The Challenge**\n\nThere\u2019s a big change coming in the social welfare system in the Netherlands. As of 2015, the central government will delegate many of its tasks around social security and healthcare to local municipalities. When this happens, local communities themselves will create and implement their own laws for social welfare and long-term care of the sick and elderly, giving them a chance to independently decide and implement the laws, according to their own methods.\u00a0\n\nThis new law is called \u201c\u2018Wet Maatschappelijke Ondersteuning\u201d, or WMO. While this is a great opportunity, it also creates a lot of challenges. Local municipalities may not have the knowledge and skills required to take on this new task.\n\nThe main goal of the hackathon is to develop apps that in some way support the new implementation of WMO by municipalities.\n\n\u201cWMO consultants\u201d are professionals who will help municipalities make this transition, by organizing access to proper care, deciding on appropriate funding levels, matching care options to consumers, and delivering a fair and efficient care delivery model. Salesforce wants to help these WMO consultants, as well as the care providers and the customers to streamline and optimize this new process.\n\nWe challenge you to create apps to support WMO consultants and municipalities in this transition.\n\nSome examples of themes and problems to be solved:\n\n\u25cf\u00a0 Enabling face-to-face \u201ckitchen table\u201d conversations between WMO Consultants and consumers eligible for assistance\n\n\u25cf\u00a0 Dealing with limited funds for welfare and health care such as a fair method of distribution.\n\n\u25cf\u00a0 Processes and workflows for municipalities to run smoothly\n\n\u25cf\u00a0 Strategies for municipalities to inform citizens about this new policy.\n\n*Appsterdam or Salesforce will not be taking ownership or any IP rights to the Entries.*\n\n",

Josh will tell us about \"Finding the Intersection: Thoughts on Art & Tech\"\n\nWe've extended the time to 3:00PM, but don't worry if you have to have to leave early. You're welcome to come join us for as long as you can!\n\nMore details are below.\n\n**Ist Speaker**\n\n**Wilbert\u00a0Baan**\n\nSummary:\n\n**Product Design:** Digital products and services drive today's companies. Startups are disrupting entire industries. Platform-thinking triumphs company-thinking. Companies have to embrace platform thinking. In this session Wilbert will share his ideas about product design and what he has learned developing new digital products for and within large companies.\n\nBio:\n\n**Wilbert Baan** graduated the Utrecht School for the Arts on concept development for digital media. He worked for the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant\/PCM uitgevers on (new) digital platforms and products. In 2011 he co-founded Somehow. A digital product design studio. Somehow helps companies to design and develop software products.\n\n**2nd Speaker**\n\n**Josh Michaels**\n\nSummary:\n\n**Finding the Intersection: Thoughts on Art & Tech:** Apple always says that the best products come from the intersection of technology and the arts, but where exactly is that? What does Apple mean? In this talk Josh will discuss a number of different challenges he's faced working at the intersection. From getting artists and engineers to work effectively together to exploring some of the economic and cultural issues they face. Josh will share his own personal story of coming into the art world as an engineer mixed with observations and lessons learned along the way.\n\nBio:\n\n**Josh Michaels** is an independent app developer and the primary force behind Jetson Creative, a Portland, Oregon, USA based app development studio. Josh started working on apps for iPhone as soon as the App Store opened beginning with the highly successful Map My Fitness series of apps launched in summer 2008. Josh then released his first game the cult hit \"Ow My Balls!\u201d in Spring 2009. The game ultimately soared to the #1 spot in the App Store and now has more than 4 million installs worldwide.\n\nJosh is currently working on expanding his hit relaxation app \"Magic Window\u201d which brings time lapse photography and relaxing sounds to iPad, iPhone, Mac, and Android devices. He also has several unannounced apps coming later this year including his first new game in more than four years. Josh has a BS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before going independent he worked at a range of companies and startups including Microsoft, Doppelganger, UpCompany, and TokBox. You can find out more about Josh online at [http:\/\/joshjet.com\/](http:\/\/joshjet.com\/) or on twitter @joshjet.\n\n\u00a0\n\n12:30 Doors open, lunch\n\n13:00 Presentations start\n\n15:00 Presentations end\n\n15:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own sandwich topping to share with others.\n\n",

Speakers have just been announced for the Cloud Platform Roadshow here on April 8: Andrew Jessup, Daniel Galpin and Robert-Jan Huijsman\n\nIt's free to come, so I hope you will join for some inspiration and hands-on look at the new tools, rapidly building your mobile backend, and more.\n\nPlease be sure to also register at the [Google Cloud Platform Roadshow page](http:\/\/lp.google-mkto.com\/cloud-platform-roadshow.html?utm_source=appsterdam&utm_medium=social), so they know to print you a nametag and how much food to buy!\n\n**Sessions:**\n\n**From Zero to Fully-Functioning App\n\n** In just one hour we'll step through everything you need to build an Android application that uses Cloud services to provide a fun experience. You'll see many of the elements of the platform in action, including Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Storage, VM Engines, Cloud Endpoints and much more. You'll come away seeing how easy it is to build an application that runs at Google scale.\n\n**Blurring the Iaas\/PaaS Divide\n\n** We're introducing a brand new way of thinking about development for the cloud -- one which takes the best of both IaaS and PaaS but removes the false choice. What if you wanted to build an app that had the great management of one built on a PaaS platform, but needed capabilities that weren't supported. You could build it using IaaS, but you'd need to do a lot of management. In this session we'll show you how this wall can be breached, and how you can start building applications for the next version of the cloud.\n\n**New Frontiers in Cloud Development\n\n** We have a wonderful new way for developers to build cloud applications. We can't talk much about it yet, but we know you're going to love it. In this session you'll get hands-on with how to use it!\n\n",

On one side there are the people with an, often brilliant, idea. They just need a developer to build it for them. Cheap, please. On the other side there are the developers, who'd often wish that the expectations of the idea people were a bit more realistic.\n\nThis talk targets both idea people and developers, to bring them closer together and manage their expectations. There's a lot they can learn from each other!\n\nA guru session will be planned as well, targeting people with an idea, to get their ideas closer to reality and realisation in a hands-on workshop. Preliminary date is June 28, more info will follow.\u00a0\n\nLecturer's Brief Bio\n\nMarion de Groot is an independent requirements analyst and functional designer at Pick my Brain.

In the past, building a back end meant renting some hardware or virtual machine, setting up the operative system, configuring the server, database, storage and writing the application logic. Nowadays great services and tools that allow to quickly setup a back end are spreading. I will provide an overview of the services which allow developers to integrate their mobile applications with back end functionalities and I am going to illustrate the features of BaasBox, an open source back end, and its SDKs.\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\n**Description\u00a0**\n\nAutomated testing is a challenge for Mobile Developers. During this guru session, we will dive into automated testing for Android or iOS using Calabash.\n\nCalabash could be compared to Selenium for smartphones. It is a functional testing tool\/language based on business language also used in your user stories. Calabash enables you to programmatically tell your device (phone, tablet or emulator) what to do. This will enable you, as a programmer, to check the functional behavior of your cross platform apps (Android or iOS) like a human would. For smaller projects you might choose to do this yourself, but when applications become larger and thus will contain more and more functionality and features, you will want to automate this in some way.\n\nUsing native libraries, Calabash is able to simulate end\u00aduser (human\u00adlike) actions such as touch gestures (tap, swipe, and rotate), assertions such as determining there is a \"login\" button or that a web view contains an \"&lt;h1&gt;\" tag, or take screenshots of the current screen of the device.\n\nDuring the guru session at M2Mobi, we will present how Calabash can be used for automated testing in your project and we will create an automated testing script for a sample application to try it out directly.\u00a0\n\n**Requirements**\n\n\u25cf \u00a0Laptop with development tools installed.\n\n\u25cf \u00a0Experience with Android or iOS development.\n\n**Program**\n\n\u25cf \u00a013:00 \u00ad 14:00 lunch with introduction presentation\n\n\u25cf \u00a014:00 \u00ad 17:00 write your own automated testing scripts\n\n\u25cf \u00a017:00 \u00ad 18:00 drinks\u00a0\n\n",

                "description": "Join us on February 15 as we celebrate our 4th Annual Kohlfahrt in Bremen, Germany!\n\n**A kohl-what?!?**\n\nThe season of long nights in northern Europe can become dreary and depressing, and a winter feast is just the thing, but trudging through snow to the feasting hall isn't any kind of fun\u2014unless you make it fun. Thus was born the northern German tradition of the ***Kohlfahrt***, or \"cabbage quest.\" Join us as we brave Bremen's frozen forests, dragging wagons of booze. Along the way we will make frequent stops to lighten our load with drinking games, and lighten our mood with party games.\n\nUpon arriving at the feasting hall, we will slake our thirst with soup and beer, and fill our bellies with sausage, potatoes, and lest we forget\u2014cabbage. The people who eat the most and dominate the games are crowned Cabbage King and Queen, and granted the solemn duty of organizing next year's kohlfahrt. Then we dance the night away like people who don't know how to dance, but aren't about to let that stop them from having a good time.\n\nDid we mention the booze wagon? Check out some photos of last year's kohlfahrt from [@mariusLAN](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mariuslan\/sets\/72157632843443665\/detail\/) and [@_jona_as](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/jojppa\/sets\/72157632840763673\/)!\n\nThis event is in partnership with [Cocoaheads Bremen](http:\/\/cocoaheads.org\/de\/Bremen\/index.html).\n\n**The Details:**\n\nPayment: The \u20ac60 price will pay for all-you-can-eat food and drinks. Please wire your money to Alexander Repty; details are in comments below. You can also\u00a0[Paypal](http:\/\/www.paypal.com)\u00a0to [masked], but wire transfer is preferred. Payment is due January 31st.\u00a0\n\nTransportation from Amsterdam:\n\nBy train: A roundtrip ticket from Amsterdam Centraal is about \u20ac58. Duration: 4.5-5 hrs. Plan on arriving in Bremen Hbf either the day before or by 2:00pm on February 15. Check [bahn.com](http:\/\/bahn.com\/i\/view\/index.shtml) for accurate rates and availability.\n\nBy bus: A roundtrip ticket is \u20ac47-68. Duration: 6 hrs. Check [touring.de](http:\/\/www.touring.de\/) for accurate rates and availability.\n\nAccommodation: A couple people in Bremen might have rooms\/couches\/beds for out-of-towners. We can also book rooms at a local hostel. For sleeping arrangements, please mention it in your RSVP.\n\nRecommended Clothes:\n\nYou will need some walking shoes - preferably warm shoes. Get a cap or something similar to protect your ears - it's windy. It's gonna be cold, so dressing in layers is highly recommend. But remember there will be music and dancing after dinner so you'll want to have something nice on underneath for when we get to the restaurant.\n\nLocals:\n\nPlease let us know if you have Kohlfahrtgl\u00e4ser or a couch to offer.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email Judy Chen: [masked]\n\n",

The beacon can transmit data to an iPhone - and visa versa - using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).\n\niBeacon is a feature in iOS 7, thus Apple's new iPhones will have iBeacon.\u00a0Say you own an iPhone 5S and you're walking by a Starbucks that has a beacon. When you enter its zone, the beacon will transmit special promotions, coupons, recommendations, etc, to your iPhone via the Starbucks app. Beacons will also accept payments, so you can pay for a Starbucks coffee without having to bump or tap your phone against anything.\n\nThis hands on iBeacon day is offered and hosted by our sponsor [Glimworm](http:\/\/www.glimworm.com\/), who hosts our [Wednesday Lectures](http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Appsterdam\/events\/155205422\/) every week.\u00a0\n\n**\n\nHands on**\n\nThere will be a minimum of 5 prototype iBeacons and the ability to set them up in any configuration. The intention of the day get as many developers, UX and UI designers to come together and explore creative possibilities.\n\nIf you are an IOS developer you probably have seen the new additions to Core Bluetooth that allow interaction with iBeacons that were added with IOS7. You may have tried it out by turning an iPhone or a Mavericks laptop into a beacon. This day you will have the opportunity to write some code that works in a room with multiple programmable beacons because that is what it is all about.\n\nGlimworm wrote a simple configuration app to detect and program the beacons remotely to set them up with any UUID, major and minor numbers you want to try out. They are battery operated so we can move them around into all sorts of funky places.\n\nSince there is a lot of press about iBeacons and you will find three articles with more information at the bottom of this page. The first shows us 10 things we can already do with iBeacons using the [Geohopper App](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/geohopper\/id605160102), the second gives 5 examples where UX design will change, and the third gives 4 ways of how iBeacons will disrupt Interaction design.\n\nWe would like to try as many of these concepts as possible so the more coders, UX and UI designers who come along the better.\n\nThe day will be filmed so that we can make a video for the website and maybe even for Kickstarter or Indigogo.\n\n**Explanation for developers wanting to join**\n\nIf you have not worked with iBeacons before think of it like a hotspot. You program into your app the UUIDs of the beacons you want to respond to and then when you come in range you get a system notification which can wake your app and you get a payload of a major code a minor code and a proximity. When you have 3 or more you can use the proximity to also triangulate a local position.\n\nAt their simplest they act like QR codes or NFC without you needing you to point you phone at them or touch them at 30m distance. \u00a0At their most impressive they could be used for micro-location.\n\nMany beacons can share a UUID so you can listen for a all beacons with the same UUID and then find all the beacons around you, then you can use the major and minor numbers to indicate which area you are passing through and which beacon you are near.\n\nAlternatively you can listen only for one beacon by listening only for a single combination of UUID, Major and Minor.\n\n**API**\n\nGlimworm created a simple cloud management platform for the beacons which you can use for registering the beacons and connection beacons to advertised content in your apps. This can be used in the cloud or downloaded as open source. \u00a0An instance will be up and running on a server for this day.\n\n**Any Passbook experts out there?**\n\nIf anyone knows how to program for passbook you can link them to passbook entries and we would like to to see this working, so please come and help us!\n\n**Who knows how to Triangulate?**\n\nAlso if you know about location triangulation we\u2019d love to see someone try this.\n\n**Bring a pie (Raspberry of course)**\n\nYou can set up the Raspberry Pi as iBeacon and Glimworm will bring a couple along to use a Raspberry PI working as a beacon. You are welcome to being your own Pi and and a blank SD card and we will burn the beacon Pi beacon software for you.\n\nYou need to bring a BT4 USB unit with you, you can get one\u00a0[here](http:\/\/www.mycom.nl\/desktops-randapparatuur\/netwerk-internet\/bluetooth-dongle\/506858\/sitecom-micro-bluetooth-40) if you don\u2019t have one.\n\n**\n\nI want my own iBeacon**\n\nBesides the iBeacon prototypes to play with, Glimworm can also\u00a0make up your very own iBeacon without a fancy case and which would look perfect on the set of Mad Max...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt consists of an HM-10 bluetooth transmitter which can be wired up to your USB port using an FTDI adapter:\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/9\/a\/600_320969082.jpeg\" \/>\n\nIf you would like to have one of those, you can order one when RSVPing (question is posed). Bring \u20ac20 in cash (HM-10 is \u20ac5, FTDI adapter is \u20ac15). Or you can order an\u00a0[FTDI adapter](http:\/\/lowpowerlab.com\/shop\/FTDI-Adapter)\u00a0and an [HM-10](http:\/\/imall.iteadstudio.com\/im130614001.html) yourself.\n\nBring your laptop or USB charger, as well as a USB-MiniB cable:\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/f\/1\/8\/600_321276632.jpeg\" \/>\n\n**\n\nFurther reading**\n\nFor some more background, here are the three articles we will use\n\n***Article 1 : 10 Things you can do now with iBeacons***\n\nGeohopper is a suite of ready made apps for automating beacons. In their blog they cite [10 things you can do now with iBeacons](http:\/\/blog.twocanoes.com\/post\/68861362715\/10-awesome-things-you-can-do-today-with-ibeacons).\n\n\u00a01. \u201cAuto-Lock and walk\u201d your Mac\n\n\u00a02. Flip iChat Status to \u201cOut\u201d when stepping away\n\n\u00a03. Send a notification as you arrive\n\n\u00a04. Create your own \u201cclub card\u201d with passbook\n\n\u00a05. Remotely snap a webcam photo and email it to yourself\n\n\u00a06. Light turn on when you arrive\n\n\u00a07. Post to group chat \u00a0as staff enter or leave the building\n\n\u00a08. Make a dramatic entrance as \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d starts playing when you walk in.\n\n\u00a09. Keep a log of when you enter and leave your car in google docs\n\n10. Post a message to Twitter when near a beacon\n\nWe want to try all of these on the 11th so please volunteer if you want to make on of them happen.\n\n***Atricle 2 : 5 UX Predictions for a World of iBeacons in 2014***\n\nDoug Thompson writes in his article about [how beacons will inspire a new generation of UX designers](http:\/\/beekn.net\/2013\/12\/5-ux-predictions-for-ibeacons-2014\/)\n\n1. iBeacons as Pins, Drop-Offs and Bulletin Boards\n\n2. Experiences Where The User is the Beacon\n\n3. Beacons Will Tie to Physical World UX\n\n4. Most Beacons Will Be Invisible to the User\n\n5. Some Beacons Will Glow\n\nDoug Thompson is a longtime blogger on technology and a serial entrepreneur. He is based in Toronto, Canada and is Co-Founder of LOCOLO, Ltd. which is helping brands and organizations to reach consumers through iBeacon and the Internet of Things. You can drop him a line at [[masked]](mailto:[masked]) or follow him on [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Dusanwriter) or [LinkedIn](http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/profile\/view?id=18258706&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=R9ZN).\n\n***Article 3 : 4 reasons why Apple's iBeacon is about to disrupt interaction design***\n\nKyle Vanhemert of Wired writes in his article how the world of interaction design is changing due to what he calls the [most exciting technological trend of 2013](http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/news\/archive\/2013-12\/12\/apple-ibeacon).\n\n1. Tying digital content to the physical world\n\n2. Seamless setup for all your gadgets\n\n3. Retail 2.0\n\n4. A new level of peer-to-peer smarts\n\n**Acknowledgment**\u00a0\n\nGlimworm's Paul Mainwaring and Jonathan Carter decided only a month ago to start producing iBeacons. They formed a consortium with hardware genius Sven Haitjema and industrial designers John Tillema and Dimer Schaefer, together called [Tweetonig](http:\/\/www.tweetonig.nl\/). They are now ready to mass produce iBeacons which will be called the \u201cGlimWorm\u201d.\n\nPaul, Jonathan, Sven, John and Dimar will all be present to conduct the event.\n\nAt this day, Glimworm will be taking pre-orders for packs of four, for 100 euro per pack.\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/9\/e\/0\/4\/600_320980452.jpeg\" \/>\n\n",

The two main things we'll do, is have a Potluck Dinner and a White Elephant Gift Exchange.\n\n**Potluck Dinner**:\n\nEveryone brings something to eat or drink to share. It doesn't matter if it's homemade or store bought.To make sure we'll end up with a good balance, we'll assign everyone with a category. After the RSVP is closed, we'll send an e-mail to all attendees with details on this.\n\n**White Elephant Gift Exchange**:\n\nThe one tradition of the Appsterdam Holiday Gathering, is our own way of doing a White Elephant Gift Exchange. Everyone needs to bring a gift, preferably without spending any money. Anything you have lying around the house and don't use, a gift you got from your aunt who has a different taste than you do, something you have made yourself... It can be something fun, something useful, anything, as long as it is wrapped as a gift. All gifts are stacked in the center and will be divided through a game where both luck and strategy are factors.\n\nUsually afterwards we hang around a bit longer, maybe have a drink, share stories about our Holliday traditions and maybe even sing a few songs.\n\nWe hope to see you there!\n\nAs a reminder, the assigned Potluck categories as you've received by e-mail:\n\nMerel Ivens - Tableware\/disposables\n\nJudy Chen - Tableware\/disposables\n\nGiovanni Maggini +1 - Beer and\/or wine (2x)\n\nBram Geenen - Side dish\n\nWesley De Groot - Soft drinks\n\nMike Lee - Soft drinks\n\nMartinus Meiborg - Main dish\n\nRudolf J - Beer and\/or wine\n\ndanny sukdeo - Side dish\n\nJon Woodroof - Soft drinks\n\nJon Woodroof - Dessert\/sweet snacks\n\nEvgeni Kogan - Main dish\n\nYana Poteeva - Soft drinks\n\nYana Poteeva - Main dish\n\nValentina Rao - Main dish\n\nThiago Varandas - Savory snacks\n\nJonathan - Dessert\/sweet snacks\n\nPaul Darcey - Beer and\/or wine\n\npaul - Soft drinks\n\npaul - Main dish\n\npaul - Dessert\/sweet snacks\n\nAlexander De Jong - Soft drinks\n\nAlexander De Jong - Main dish\n\nTom van Arman - Savory snacks\n\nSamual \"Ryan\" Goodwin - Savory snacks\n\nSijmen Mulder - Dessert\/sweet snacks\n\nLiz Bostock - Side dish\n\nLawrence - Soft drinks\n\nLawrence - Side dish\n\nVirnalia - Savory snacks\n\nErik Romijn - Beer and\/or wine\n\nMagnus Dahl - Side dish\n\nMore detailed info was send via e-mail.

By the end of the session, you'll have a grasp of the UI coding, connecting to network resources, and the Xcode IDE... and most important, the skeleton of your first application. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n11:00-11:30: Doors open, environment check.\u00a0\n\n11:00-12:30: Objective-C exercises (in case you didn't read the tutorial)\u00a0\n\n12:30-13:30: Lunch break\u00a0\n\n13:30-17:00: iOS training and hands-on exercises!\u00a0\n\n17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer This session is targeted at developers who haven't yet learned iOS programming, or haven't yet flexed their muscles with it. Prerequisites:\n\n(1) Your Mac with Xcode 5 installed, which can be installed from the App Store.\n\n(2) You will get a LOT more out of this session if you familiarize yourself with the basics of Objective-C. We recommend you [run through this tutorial beforehand.](http:\/\/cocoadevcentral.com\/d\/learn_objectivec\/)\n\n**Speakers Bio**\n\nSamuel has been developing software for Apple platforms since 2007. He has worked as a freelancer as well as developing in-house software for a NYC startup. He rides skateboards and plays the electric bass.

I pursue the vision that app marketing is mostly oriented to managing expectations of a platform - an app store. For now, this is by far the most effective channel for marketing an app. In order to market your app successfully, you need to understand the platform as deep as you can. This lecture will hopefully give new insights into app store ecosystem.\n\nFor my Master thesis I looked at app stores as promotional platforms and their influence on marketing practices of app makers. During the lecture I will present the most interesting results of my research. I will share some valuable data showing the impact of getting featured on app downloads. We will also look at marketing cases of such apps as Foldify, Weathercube, Fietsfinder.\n\nFinally, I will give practical recommendations on developing a strategy for the app launch as well as deploying such app marketing techniques as App Store Optimisation, localisation, getting user reviews, app advertising, getting reviewed by app-centric media.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTwitter: @dariakore\n\nWebsite:\u00a0[http:\/\/dkoreniushkina.blogspot.nl\/](http:\/\/dkoreniushkina.blogspot.nl\/)\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

                "description": "This week we have **Marion de Groot**, who will speak about **Agile Functional Design**.\n\nAgile is in fashion and Scrum is the way to go. \"No more of those boring, endless specifications!\" It sounds very appealing, but getting rid of all form of documentation is a bit too radical.\n\nFunctional Design is about what the software does, as opposed to what it looks like or how it's built. The importance of functional design is often overlooked, especially in Agile projects. Functional design is often linked to old-fashioned 'Waterfall' projects and large documents.\n\nThis presentation briefly explains the concepts of Functional Design, Waterfall and Agile for those who are not familiar with them. It explains the importance of 'thinking before doing' and how Functional Design can be done in an Agile way, and implemented in Scrum projects. This can be interesting for anyone remotely or closely involved in software development projects, with or without Scrum.\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking. Our lectures cover a wide range of topics related to making apps on any platform, from technical to non-technical including computer languages, modelling, testing, design, marketing, business philosophy, startups, strategizing, and more.\n\nIn the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together.

Free coffee and wifi.\n\nLast year we had a temporary spot just like it at Westergasfabriek, and now we have a new one located just across the IJ in the old Shell Lab buildings.\n\nCheck out the [panorama pic](http:\/\/360.io\/SCRLA4) of our room!\n\n**Getting There**\n\nTake the free ferry from Centraal Station to Buiksloterweg, which comes every 5 minutes. As you're looking north from the ferry, you'll see a large red brick building that says \"A Lab\" (it's pretty hard to miss). From the ferry dock, head left towards the Eye Film Institute, cross the small bridge, then make an immediate right through the metal gate. When you enter A Lab, head right from the coffee lounge and our room is the first on the right--Workhotel.001!\n\n",

The goal of this meeting is for Stefan Eisses of Rapp Trans (NL) b.v. who is working directly for the government minister to get a developers viewpoint from Appsterdam members.\n\nThe meeting has been arranged by Glimworm and a core set of people who worked on the DIVV multi modal api report are already invited.\n\nAnyone from Appsterdam is welcome to join and be part of the process. Upon RSVP-ing you'll be prompted for\u00a0brief sentence on involvement and interest in open data and \/ or mobility as we may have to limit the group as time is tight.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAGENDA\n\n1. Brief introduction by Jonathan\n\n2. Round of developer wishes\n\n3. Brief explanation of the project by Stefan\n\n4. Action plan\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeveloper Wish List\n\nI have already put the following items on the developer wish list:\n\n1. The data should be available without a user account or complicated sign up\n\n2. The data should be easily usable by developers i.e. json format, standard longitude,latitude etc..; and also include real time availability where is it not impossible.\n\n3. There should be a contact person for the data to answer data related questions\n\n4. The data should be useable in any way we like and we should be able to store it. \u00a0For instance we should be able to collect data over time and make our own predictive models\n\n5.We should be able to use the data to criticize the parking authorities if we want to.\n\n6. Parking tariff information must not be fixed data as we already know that variable rate parking is here this year. (see : sf-park )\n\n7. All necessary calculation formulas , for instance for day cards should be published.\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

You believe your idea is incredible and people can't wait to get their hands on it. However, very quickly you discover that one of the most critical challenges is to understand and adapt to your customers' needs. So you get out of the building, collect customer insights, and you pivot until you have found a proposition that stands out from the clutter.\n\nDuring this talk I will share some thoughts and examples on why it is still important to stay close to your personal motivations, and how powerful it is to use these in turning your app into a success.\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

Creative Research is experimental, interdisciplinary research. Artists, creatives and end users have a central position: Users as Designers. Creative Research is related to participatory design, rapid prototyping, practice based research and tinkering. Waag Society has a strong focus to let user groups participate in internet, new media and technology that otherwise have limited access.\n\nWaag Society hosts [Fablab](http:\/\/waag.org\/en\/service\/fablab-amsterdam) Amsterdam, where anyone can realize their ideas, with the aid of digital equipment transforming those ideas into prototypes and products. Fablab Amsterdam is situated at the [Waag](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Waag_(Amsterdam)) in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Fablab was developed by [Neil Gershenfeld](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neil_Gershenfeld) from MIT during a class 'How to make almost anything'. It stands for Fabrication Laboratory. Fablab has developed into a global network of standardized open hardware setups.\n\nWaag Society offers workshop formats for technical education, but also uses the Fablab as a rapid prototyping facility for projects. The Fablabs around the world are connected to each other by using an advanced video conferencing system for\u00a0sharing knowledge and ideas. Fablab Amsterdam is open two days a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays) for the general public to come in and realize their own ideas (on appointment).

Thus was born the northern German tradition of the ***Kohlfahrt***, or \"cabbage quest.\" Join us as we brave Bremen's frozen forests, dragging wagons of booze. Along the way we will make frequent stops to lighten our load with drinking games, and lighten our mood with party games.\n\nUpon arriving at the [feasting hall](http:\/\/www.grasberger-hof.de\/pages\/kohlfahrten\/kohlfahrten.htm), we will slake our thirst with soup and beer, and fill our bellies with sausage, potatoes, and lest we forget\u2014cabbage. The people who eat the most and dominate the games are crowned Cabbage King and Queen, and granted the solemn duty of organizing next year's kohlfahrt. Then we dance the night away like people who don't know how to dance, but aren't about to let that stop them from having a good time.\n\nDid we mention the booze wagon? Check out some [photos of last year's kohlfahrt](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/alexrepty\/sets\/72157629147435306\/)!\n\nThis event is in partnership with [Cocoaheads Bremen](http:\/\/cocoaheads.org\/de\/Bremen\/index.html).\n\n**The Details:**\n\nPayment: The \u20ac58,50 price will pay for all-you-can-drink booze and all-you-can-eat food.

We've cleaned him up and will set him down to answer some questions.\n\nWhere did you go? What did you see? What did you learn? What did you bring back? Where do we go from here? We'll talk about the future\u2014not in some grand sense, but at the day-to-day street-level of workers in the future-bringing industry. We'll talk about the New Lemurs, and the quest to make a new kind of game to teach a new kind of science. We'll talk about the importance of staying uncomfortable, challenging yourself to see and do things differently. We'll talk about what to do when you're an App Maker who is independent in spirit, but not in finances, in an App Universe where the white-hot expansion is over. We'll talk about structuring our businesses without being able to rely on explosive growth, in an indifferent market. Can we change our relationship with failure? Finally we'll talk about Appsterdam, what it has been, and what it should become. What does it mean to us? What is it worth to us?\n\nDon't miss this intimate Town Hall style lecture with the one and only Mike Lee.\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nThe [D3 Javascript Library](http:\/\/d3js.org\/) is used for building data driven documents and visualizations, but the learning curve is pretty steep.\u00a0This session will be a shared learning experience: Vincent D. Warmerdam will provide some data and challenges, attendees will break up into teams and tackle them with\u00a0D3. At points during the day you'll share lessons, and at the end show off your great results!\n\nAgenda:\n\n10:00-10:30: Doors open, participants sign in\n\n10:30-11:30: Short D3 introduction, sample data set (hint: we will try to conquer the world with this dataset)\u00a0\n\n11:30: Break into teams and get to work!\n\n19:00-20:00: Final presentations and sharing\n\nThis session is meant for a technical audience, dataminers and developers. Dataviz people and designers are welcome too, but keep in mind everyone will be exploring a new library so you shouldn't be afraid to jump into the Javascript and you should be familiar with code.\n\nIf you are a javascript expert and if you have familiarity with (google) maps, know that you are VERY welcome to join the fun. \u00a0If you want to prepare for the session you may to try this first tutorial:\u00a0[http:\/\/alignedleft.com\/tutorials\/d3\/](http:\/\/alignedleft.com\/tutorials\/d3\/)\n\n(You can also bring your own datasets and challenges to tackle)\n\n",

For anyone else interested: **we will share the outcome of the discussion afterwards in a Wednesday Lunch Lecture** so everyone can benefit from it!\n\nBefore the event we will send all participants a short e-mail in which we will ask you a few short questions about your app(s) in order to be well prepared and get the most out of the session.\n\nYour moderator and host for the day will be Paul Darcey and Eddy Oosterhuis.\n\n",

In this session we'll discuss some basic machine learning methods and some data related tricks.\u00a0After this guru session you'll have:\n\n- Learned basic usage of R methods, objects and libraries.\u00a0\n\n- Ripped a summary of your data in two lines of code.\n\n- Experimented with different ways of plotting.\n\n- Visualized the best way to feed a chicken\n\n- Find a hack such that you can buy cheap plane tickets\n\n- Predict the price of a house in the future\n\n- Written a script that recognizes pixels on an input field in order to recognize a digit. (so you'll even learn a bit about artificial intelligence)\n\nAgenda:\n\n10:00-10:30: Doors open, participants sign in\n\n10:30-12:30: Session starts - Intro exercises\n\n12:30-13:30: Lunch break\n\n13:30-17:00: Session continues - deeper exercises\n\n17:00 onwards: Pizza and beer!\n\nThis session is meant for anyone who is interested in knowing a bit more about data mining.\u00a0 Before the session you'll need to have R installed.\u00a0If you want to bring your own data to play with instead or have an expert looked at you are encouraged to bring it along with you.\n\n",

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nNowadays more and more people need to get into programming, either to start a career as a software developer, or because they are eager to create new products and it's hard for them to find technical talent available.\n\nIn this session we will look at the basics of programming, using Ruby as a programming language since it's one of the most user friendly language while being the tool of choice for a vast amount of professionals. As you will learn as you get more experienced, once you learn the basic concepts of programming, you can pick any language or platform you want, so this session is addressed to everybody who wants to learn how to code, even if they plan to switch to another technology later.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n17:30-18:00: Doors open, sign-in and set-up\n\n18:00-21:30: Session (will include a 30 min dinner break).\n\nYou don't need to have any previous programming knowledge. The only prerequisite is to bring your own laptop with a text editor and Ruby installed.\n\nOn Mac OS X Ruby comes preinstalled.\n\nYou can get a text editor here: [http:\/\/www.barebones.com\/products\/textwrangler\/](http:\/\/www.barebones.com\/products\/textwrangler\/)\n\nFor Windows you can find Ruby here: [http:\/\/rubyinstaller.org](http:\/\/rubyinstaller.org)\n\nYou can get a text editor here: [http:\/\/notepad-plus-plus.org](http:\/\/notepad-plus-plus.org)\n\nIf you are using Linux, you can follow these instructions: [http:\/\/ruby.learncodethehardway.org\/book\/ex0.html&#35;linux](http:\/\/ruby.learncodethehardway.org\/book\/ex0.html#linux)\n\nWe will provide some snacks and beers to make the gathering more\u00a0gezellig.

How do you stack the odds in your favor? What good practices have you adopted and what do you avoid? What do you do wrong? How is appreneurship different from entrepreneurship? What obstacles have you faced and how did you deal with them? Where do you find your inspiration as an entrepreneur? How can Appsterdam support appreneurship more?\n\nCome share your experiences and appreneurial stories - WINS and FAILS! The agenda is open, you decide the topics. Participate in discussions about what it means to be an appreneur and how you can be the best at what you do. Inspiring videos will spark discussions and we will do one or two simple excercises with practical tools like the business model canvas, that you can apply in your daily business (have suggestions?).\n\nThe program will be based on whoever comes to the event and their topics and stories. So you are invited to suggest content we should put on the agenda. Here is a hint of what we can do:\n\n* talk about appreneurship,\n\n* play with the business model canvas or other entrepreneur\u2019s tools,\n\n* discuss bits from \u201cRework\u201d or other inspiring books,\n\n* watch and discuss TED talk videos,\n\n* discuss business cases (bring your own if you like help).\n\nIt\u2019s up to you! If you have suggestions for the program (topics, videos, excercises, business cases), please contact Casper Koomen at [masked].\n\nWe start at 9.30 and finish at 12.30. Entrance is free.

CIOs, senior managers, IT managers, business development managers, entrepreneurs - they all need to be out front, leading the change. It is about putting the \u201cbusiness\u201d out to where the customers are. This is about flexibility and adaptability, working to new rules of design - making technology invisible by putting users at the centre of design.\n\nFacebook, in just over two short years, has quintupled in size to a network that touches more than 800 million active users. More than 4 billion people around the world now use cell phones, and for 450 million of those people the Web is a fully mobile experience.\n\nThe ways information technologies are deployed are changing too, as the confluence of smart systems, social media, mobile and cloud computing reallocate technology costs and usage patterns. At the same time new ways are being created for individuals to consume goods and services and for entrepreneurs and companies to dream up viable business models. Smart phones and tablets are ubiquitous, and they are rapidly transforming how we all shop, connect, get around, and lead our daily lives. And Big Data makes sense of the exponentially increasing amounts of information in daily life. The phrase \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019 describes this rapidly shifting technology environment \u2013 raising serious questions for executives about how to help their companies capitalize on the transformation under way. Now it\u2019s all about how to adapt management and organizational structures to meet these demands.\n\nSee [www.perfectstormeurope.com](http:\/\/www.perfectstormeurope.com) for all event details.

To help with this,\u00a0Google created the\u00a0[Android Design Site](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/design\/index.html) explaining how things\u00a0should be. But the UI components are only available on newer versions of Android... What to do???\n\n[Raul Portales of Plattysoft](https:\/\/twitter.com\/sla_shalafi) will present the main UI paradigms that Google is\u00a0pushing forward and discuss them - and also teach about the compatibility library and ActionBarSherlock that helps you apply these UI paradigms, especially the Action Bar even on older versions of Android!\n\nIn\u00a0the hands-on exercises, each person will create a sample project that\u00a0uses ActionBarSherlock and make use of some of this paradigms.\u00a0You are encouraged to build\u00a0something beyond the basic exercise, or even start migrating your existing app to this\u00a0paradigm.\n\nAgenda:\n\n11:00-11:30: Doors open, sign-in\n\n11:30-12:30: UI Patterns\n\n12:30-13:30: Lunch break\n\n13:30-17:00: Hands-on exercises: Build new, or adapt your old apps!\n\n17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer\n\nThe session is focused on developers that have basic knowledge of Android but want to build better looking apps (that should be all of you!) and that have not used ActionBarSherlock before. Designers are welcome too, and will learn from the UI discussions... but may want to team up with a developer during the hands-on exercises.\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

By the end of the session, you'll have a grasp of the UI coding, connecting to network resources, and the Xcode IDE... and most important, the skeleton of your first application. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.\n\nAgenda:\n\n11:00-11:30: Doors open, environment check.\n\n11:00-12:30: Objective-C exercises (in case you didn't read the tutorial)\n\n12:30-13:30: Lunch break\n\n13:30-17:00: iOS training and hands-on exercises!\n\n17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer\n\nThis session is targeted at developers who haven't yet learned iOS programming, or haven't yet flexed their muscles with it. Prerequisites:\n\n(1) Your Mac with [Xcode 4.5](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/xcode\/) installed, which can be installed from the App Store.\n\n(2) You will get a LOT more out of this session if you familiarize yourself with the basics of Objective-C. We recommend you run through [this tutorial](http:\/\/cocoadevcentral.com\/d\/learn_objectivec\/) beforehand.\n\n**Speakers Bio**\n\nSamuel has been developing software for Apple platforms since 2007. He has worked as a freelancer as well as developing in-house software for a NYC startup. He rides skateboards and plays the electric bass. He enjoys long walks on the beach, eliminating software bugs, architecting software, and boosting app performance. Currently he works on the OSX application [Slender](http:\/\/dragonforged.com\/slender\/) and various client projects for iOS.\n\n*Note: this session will be similar to the one that took place on [June 30](http:\/\/meetup.appsterdam.rs\/events\/68806992\/).*\n\n",

How\n\nto avoid spending all your time at the gym and be the most efficient?\n\nAnd what about doing sports after a long inactive period? This is\n\nalso what this presentation is about.\n\nThe presenter, Julien, is a geek guy who went on a diet some years ago. He\n\nlost more than 70 Kgs in 18 months, and he exercises to stay fit.\n\nAll his plans were made by reading scientific papers, which he first applied to himself, and then called on his experience to give advice to many others. He continues to exercise to stay fit, but mostly for fun.

                "description": "Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nYour client asks you to work **Agile**! Your team tells you they want to **Scrum**! But what do they really mean? Do you just throw away the documentation and planning? Whether you're the client, on the team, or leading the team, Scrum requires structure and discipline to do it right and reach the great benefits of working Agile.\n\nJulya van Berkel from Sogeti will lead an evening of Scrum education, hands-on exercises and games. You'll learn the basics of Scrum from both a client perspective and a Scrum Team's perspective. You'll also learn what separates Scrum\/Agile from both Waterfall method and undisciplined cowboy programming. And most important, there will be pizza, beer, good people and fun!\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n17:00 - 18:30 - Doors open, start gathering, enjoy pizza and beer\n\n18:30 - 21:30 - Get started with education and games!\n\n21:30 - 22:00 - Wrap up, discussions and beer until the hosts kick us out.\n\nThis session is targeted at anyone involved in app making who needs to learn more about Scrum and Agile: The client, customer, business developers and product owners. Developers, UX designers, graphic designers, testers, team leads. There will be no technology component, only real-life exercises.\n\n(If you're already an experienced Scrum Masters or Product Owner, you won't need this session. However if you still want to join, contact us to volunteer as an assistant coach!)\n\n",

It's going to be a good walk taking us through the history and culture of the city. Of course we'll have some stops in between to catch our breath and have a drink, please make sure you have some cash with you. At the first stop we're offering a little something to eat, but it is recommended that you already had a big breakfast or small lunch.\n\nWe'll end the tour on Stadhuisplein, the lively square a stone's throw distance from Central Station, over there we'll have dinner at Cafe Plein. Please send an e-mail to [masked] **before Thursday July 19** if you are joining for dinner. They offer a nice varied menu with very affordable prices.\n\nIn case you get lost, or want to join us later, please call Judy [masked] or Merel [masked]\n\n**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**\n\nAppsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his blog: \"Getting to know each other\u2019s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\" Everyone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more. We hope to see you soon!\n\n",

Many organizations all over have recognized the importance of data mining and have been using it to add a splurge to their income. No matter what field you are in it is important to know your data. There are many tools available like SPSS and SAS but they are expensive and limited.\n\nIn this small lecture I will discuss R, an open source tool for data analysis and statistics. I will explain how the tool works its magic through packages that are freely available and I'll also explain certain key aspects of data mining. I'll give some examples of what you could do with R as well (predict soccer outcomes, visualizing patterns).\n\nVincent a machine learning\/econometrics graduate and teaches statistics at NBS Nyerode. If there are any specific (data related) topics you would like him to address please mail him beforehand at vincentwarmerdam [at] gmail [dot] com.\n\n12:30 Doors open\n\n13:00 Presentation starts\n\n14:00 Presentation ends\n\n14:30 Venue closes\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing participants to receive training in public speaking.

                "description": "Appsterdam Guru Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between App Makers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nIn this session, [Nevan King](http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/nevaneva) will teach you how to add a map to your app, how to control the map, how to receive location information and how to add pins to mark places. In addition, you'll learn about some of the most useful pieces of iOS programming, including Frameworks, Delegates, Actions, Outlets and Views. By the end of the day you should have the experience to use maps into your own apps with confidence. Best of all, we'll provide the pizza and beer.\n\nAgenda:\n\n11:00-11:30: Doors open, environment check.\n\n11:30-13:00: Start learning\n\n13:00-13:30: Lunch break\n\n13:30-15:00: More leaning\n\n15:00-15:15: Short break\n\n15:15-17:00: Afternoon learning\n\n17:00-18:30: Pizza and Beer\n\nThis session is targeted at beginners. A little iOS programming knowledge would be helpful, but it's not strictly necessary. Prerequisites: Your Mac with [Xcode 4.3.3](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/xcode\/index.php) (the latest version) installed which can be installed from the App Store. Please make sure to download it before the session, it's a free, but big download, so there might not be enough time to download it on the day itself.\n\nYou don't need an iPhone but experience with one is a bonus. You don't need to be a registered developer.\n\nIf you want to be ahead of the curve, you can read some of the documentation:\n\nLocation Awareness Programming Guide (somewhat technical)\n\n[http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/&#35;DOCUMENTATION\/UserExperience\/Conceptual\/LocationAwarenessPG\/](http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/#DOCUMENTATION\/UserExperience\/Conceptual\/LocationAwarenessPG\/)\n\nMKMapview class (very technical)\n\n[http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/&#35;DOCUMENTATION\/MapKit\/Reference\/MKMapView_Class](http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/#DOCUMENTATION\/MapKit\/Reference\/MKMapView_Class)\n\nSpeakers Bio\n\nNevan has been programming apps using maps for several years. Every one of the apps he has released on the App Store (except that first embarrassing attempt) has incorporated a map. He loves the fact that in almost any city on the Earth that he wants to go, he can quickly get details of what's around, how to get food, how to find a friend or how to get home.\n\n",

The everyday indie dev must find creative ways to stay in business without a breakout hit. In this talk, indie developer Kirby Turner talks about what it means to him to be independent. He shares lessons learned and mistakes made over the last 8 years, and he talks about the main motivation behind his company. Hint: It's not money.\n\nKirby ([@kirbyt](https:\/\/twitter.com\/#%21\/kirbyt)) is an independent software developer, author, and business owner focusing on Mac and iOS programming. Kirby has been programming since the early 1980s. He sells his own apps through his company [White Peak Software](http:\/\/whitepeaksoftware.com\/), and he does contract programming when time allows. He recently co-wrote a book with Tom Harrington titled, [Learning iPad Programming, A Hands-On Guide to Building Apps for the iPad with iOS 5](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Learning-iPad-Programming-Hands--Building\/dp\/0321750403\/ref=la_B004FVC530_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336940899&sr=1-1).\n\nWeekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures is an initiative to allow people in Appsterdam to talk about technology and share knowledge, allowing speakers to get some training as well. Lectures have broad topics, from technical to marketing, or whatever is related to apps.\n\nIn the full sharing spirit of Appsterdam, we will eat lunch together. Our kind host will provide us with bread and drinks. Bring your own topping to share with others.\n\n",

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nOn March 24, Raul Portales of [The Pill Tree](http:\/\/thepilltree.com\/) will present a hands-on session on tools you can use for Android game development. He'll be assisted by members of Johan Pelgrim and members of [The Dutch Android User Group](http:\/\/www.dutchaug.org\/events\/51448682\/?eventId=51448682&action=detail).\n\n*When thinking about building a game for Android, one can write it from scratch. Or you can look for tools, libraries and engines that already exist so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.* *\n\n* *We did that at The Pill Tree for both Chalk Ball and Space Cat, both games have different requirements and the solutions we found were also different. In this session I will summarize the strong and weak points of AndEngine and jPCT-AE and the uses you can make of them.* *\n\n* *I will also give a brief explanation of other libraries that are interesting, such as ScoreLoop \/ OpenFeint for scores and awards and give a short introduction to virtual currency and incentivated ads.* *\n\n* *After the talk, I will provide the people with the samples of both engines and we will play around with them.* The event is at the fabulous Mediamatic Bank location, and best of all we'll round off the afternoon with Pizza and Beer.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n9:30 - 10:00 - Doors open, developers gather, coffee, environment check\n\n10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started: Presentations and exploration of Android game development tools\n\n12:00 - 17:00 - Lunch, \"Hackathon\" style guided learning with a team\n\n17:00 - Pizza and beer!\n\nThis session is targeted at developers. Basic Android knowledge recommended, knowledge of 2D \/ 3D concepts is not necessary but will not harm. You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed and ready:\u00a0[Java 7 SE JDK](http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html),\u00a0[Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/downloads\/),\u00a0[Android SDK release 13](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html), and the\u00a0[ADT Plugin for Eclipse](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/eclipse-adt.html). Whew! Here's a\u00a0[pretty good guide](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/installing.html)\u00a0if you get lost.\n\nWe ask a \u20ac25 registration fee (20 if you have a Mediamatic membership) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 30 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the\u00a0session.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Speakers Bio:**\n\n[http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/a\/0\/event_92375232.jpegRaul](http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/8\/9\/a\/0\/event_92375232.jpegRaul) is a Spanish Software Engineer who started writing MSX programs for fun when he was 12 and he still enjoys his development role today.\u00a0Raul has been working in the IT industry since 2004, but is focused on mobile development since 2006.

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nOn March 14, Appsterdam and BNO will come together to give the third of a series of hands-on sessions created for designers, from any discipline, who are interested in developing an expertise in the design of Apps for mobile devices.\n\nOur guru for the session is Ruben Bos of [Mangrove](http:\/\/www.mangrove.nl\/),\u00a0who will lead a deep-dive into designing strong User Experience (UX) for mobile Apps. At Mangrove he worked on apps like Txxi, BOVAG and Ministry of Defense. In this session he will explain UX techniques and best practices, largely based on lessons learned from years of web development.\n\nThis session is primarily targeted at Graphic and Web Designers to learn UX design for mobile, but Developers and Interaction Designers who want to improve their UX skills are also welcome. Be prepared to get your hands dirty as the workshop will be largely paper and marker based. A laptop or smartphone is not mandatory but advisable.\n\nAgenda:\n\n12:00 - Doors open, gather, eat lunch\n\n13:00 - Workshop starts\n\n17:00 - Beer, Wine, pizza and socializing until closing time\n\nWe ask a \u20ac20 registration fee (payable at the door) to cover expenses and food. 15 spaces are available to Appsterdam and non-BNO designers (signup on this page!), 15 spaces are available to BNO members (contact BNO if you are a member!)**\n\n**\n\n",

Thus was born the northern German tradition of the ***Kohlfahrt***, or \"cabbage quest.\" Join us as we brave Bremen's frozen forests, dragging wagons of booze. Along the way we will make frequent stops to lighten our load with drinking games, and lighten our mood with party games.\n\nUpon arriving at the feasting hall, we will slake our thirst with soup and beer, and fill our bellies with sausage, potatoes, and lest we forget\u0097cabbage. The people who eat the most and dominate the games are crowned Cabbage King and Queen, and granted the solemn duty of organizing next year's kohlfahrt. Then we dance the night away like people who don't know how to dance, but aren't about to let that stop them from having a good time.\n\nDid we mention the booze wagon?

Globally, about 1,000 developers are expected - from Brussels to Berlin, to Warsaw and London, to Brazzaville, Kyoto and San Diego.\n\nLearn about hands-on Android app development The event will include a beginner-level jumpstart session on the major features of Android, focused on 4.0 development, Fragments, and releasing to the Market. Android enthusiasts will be on hand to help and to answer questions throughout the weekend. Build with Us or Build Your Own Throughout the weekend, other GTUG members, locally or globally, will be building Android apps and sharing the code with you so you can code along. If, on the other hand, you already have a great idea for what to build, bring that idea with you to the hackathon, pitch it in the morning and form a team. Even better, bring along anything you can prepare ahead of time (sketches, designs, mockups, an empty template app etc.) and use the time, information and talented people provided at the hackathon to develop your idea into a working application, then share it with the world. At the end of the day, we'll invite you to share your Android app with the world. What Do I Need? We will provide facilities and experts to help you learn to use Android and write your application. Just bring your laptop, ideas, absolute concentration and enthusiasm to complete the mix. When and Where?\u00a0 The Brussels hackathon will take place Saturday and Sunday, February 18th and 19th,\u00a0from 10:00(am) to 03:00(am) the first day, and from 09:00(am) to Sunday 20:00. The location will not allow us to stay the night, so this will not be required or provided, but you are free to continue your work overnight at your own location. The deadline to finish your hack is Sunday 18:00. It will be held at [Outpost GameCenter](http:\/\/www.outpost.be\/website\/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27&Itemid=48), Rue de la Tribune 8, Brussel: \u00a0This location is accessible via train or metro via Central Station or Madou, and some limited street parking should be possible for cars.

Let's get cookin'!**\n\n[Kookstudio de Laurier](http:\/\/www.delaurier.nl\/), the first cooking studio established in Amsterdam, has been catering and teaching people how to cook for 20 years. On January 21, Chef Kati will teach us Appsterdammers how to make pasta *from scratch*. Everyone will get involved in the whole process: prepping, making, cooking, and washing up. And the best part is\u2026 we get to eat what we make! In the end, Chef Kati will send us home with recipes for the dishes we prepared.\n\nOur cooking class will be combined with a very basic Dutch lesson, lead by our very own Robert Shepard. He'll teach us the Dutch words of the ingredients we'll use as well as some basic conversational phrases. Emphasis will be on pronunciation, so this will be a great way to figure out exactly how to say such words as *grachtengordel*, *Schipol*, and *buienradar*. Even if you already speak Dutch, you can still help us clueless people out ;)\n\nAs with every Appsterdam Family Weekend, people of all ages are welcome to attend. The menu has been designed to be fun for kids and adults. Please bring your **\u20ac25 in cash** to pay on the day of the event. Beverages (soda, beer, etc.) are not included in the price so bring cash for that too. And fortunately, wine is as inexpensive as \u20ac15 per bottle. The normal fee for cooking class is \u20ac52-65 per person, so Chef Kati is really giving us a great discount.\n\nSee you all in the kitchen!\n\n\u00a0\n\n**About the Appsterdam Family Weekends:**\n\nAppsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his [blog](http:\/\/mur.mu.rs\/?p=239): \"Getting to know each other\u2019s families will help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\"\n\nEveryone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.\n\nWe hope to see you soon!\n\n",

                "description": "**Appsterdam & Waag Open Space** offer individuals the chance to host their own tech related event. Appsterdam and Waag provide all facilities, communication and infrastructure needed to host a high quality evening on a topic of your choice in one of the cities oldest and most beautiful buildings, the Waag on Nieuwmarkt.\n\nThis month **Gijs Molenaar** will host the first Amsterdam Computer Vision Meetup (ACVM). Computer Vision is a fascinating and fast growing field. The last years there have been major improvements in computer speed and therefore the ability to process images and video.\n\nAlso, a growing number of people are carying small supercomputers with integrated camera\u2019s around in their pocket.There is a lot of knowledge and curiosity in Amsterdam related to computer vision, both from a professional and an artistic perspective. But since this field is so cutting edge this knowledge is protected and locked away inside companies and universities. The recent popularity and success of social tech meetings around the world learns us that a lot can be gained by opening up, meeting and sharing experiences and knowledge.\n\n**For who?**\n\nThis event is the perfect opportunity for curious minds who want to find out more about computer vision and techniques. We also welcome professionals that want to meet fellow specialists and artists or entrepreneurs looking for inspiration. Lastly, it is an evening for employers and potential employees to meet.\n\n**Speakers**\n\nGijs Molenaar (pythonic.nl) \u2013 Short Introduction\n\nCees Snoek (euvt.eu) \u2013 Video search engines based on visual categories and events\n\nJan-Mark Geusebroek (perceptech.eu) \u2013 Visual classification of banknotes for recirculation\n\nMatthijs van Henten (ischen.nl) \u2013 Video To Sound\n\nMark de Greef (VicarVision.nl) \u2013 FaceReader\n\nJan van Gemert\u00a0(UvA) \u2013\u00a0Correlating photograpic style with object categorization\n\n\u00a0\n\nDoors Open at 19.30 \/ Program starts at 20.00\n\n\u00a0\n\n**[About Appsterdam & Waag Open Space](http:\/\/events.waag.org\/opendata\/open-space\/)**\n\nBoth Waag and Appsterdam share a goal in putting Amsterdam on the map as the new tech capital of the Europe and the world. We strongly believe that providing open frameworks is an effective way to build and strengthen a community.\n\nGive people the means and they will make it into what they need it to be. Giving people the means to contribute to ecosystem of quality tech events is yet another way to engage people in the community.\n\nHosting a quality event can prove to be a costly exercise. How do you get a venue? How to you promote your event? How do get a sponsor? What does it cost? By helping people to setup their first event and plugging them into our infrastructure we believe we will create new group of highly engaged contributors to our community. We get to know the people with ideas, get an idea of what kind of events the community is looking for. Help people to be successful by sharing our knowledge, experience and network and create the next community leaders.\u00a0We all benefit.\n\n**You have an idea for the next event?\u00a0**\n\n**submit your format to [[masked]](mailto:[masked])**\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

Find out why familiar desktop conventions are weak replacements for manipulating content directly, and learn to craft touchscreen interfaces that effortlessly teach users new gesture vocabularies. The challenge: gestures are invisible, without the visual cues offered by buttons and menus. As your touchscreen app sheds buttons, how do people figure out how to use the thing?\n\nLearn to lead your audience by the hand (and fingers) with practical techniques that make invisible gestures obvious. Designer Josh Clark, author of \"Tapworthy: Designing Great iPhone Apps,\" mines a variety of surprising sources for interface inspiration and design patterns.

When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make a sharp right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The sign for the Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right. Walk straight past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left.

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nOn December 10 we will give a hands-on Windows Phone programming session at the great [Lev Caupas co-working space](http:\/\/www.levkaupas.com\/join-the-collective\/). The workshop is meant for people new to Windows Phone programming, or haven't really \"flexed their muscles\" with it yet. We'll teach you in the way developers learn best: First we make sure you have the basic concepts at your fingertips, then we throw you in the deep end of the pool! That means you'll team up, pick an idea and start building an app, learning with your team while being supported by the facilitators. And best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.\n\nAnd best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.\n\nHosts and facilitators: Matthijs Hoekstra (Microsoft), and a collection of volunteer guides.\n\nAgenda:\n\n9:30 - Doors open, gather, coffee, environment check\n\n10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started: Hands-on introduction to Windows Phone\n\n12:00 - 17:00 - Lunch, \"Hackathon\" style guided learning with a team\n\n17:00 - Pizza and beer!\n\nThis session is targeted at developers. No Windows Phone experience necessary, but you should be comfortable with C# (or at least not afraid of it). You will need to bring a laptop with the [Windows Phone SDK 7.1](http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/download\/en\/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27570) installed and ready - pay attention to the system requirements!\u00a0 If you don't have a Windows PC, we will have a few loaner laptops so please let us know when you signup.\n\nWe ask a \u20ac20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food.

It is if they know our behaviors and sense our moods. By knowing this, they alter the state of our environment and even transform the perception of a building.

Appsterdam fully supports this initiative and is therefore partnering with StartupBus Europe, StartupBootcamp & Atlassian.\n\nBefore the StartupBus will start this journey, there will be a Kick-off Party. This Saturday December 3th, the StartupBus kick-off party will take place at Atlassian. If you're interested in meeting both 'buspreneurs' and an elite group of successful entrepreneurs, feel free to RSVP.\n\nParty starts at 7pm until 10pm.\n\nMore info on the Startup Bus:\n\nStarting in Amsterdam and ending at Paris in time for the LeWeb conference, StartupBus Europe will be an entrepreneurial competition like no other. Part-hackathon, part-road trip, participants will have 3 days to conceive, build and launch a startup while traveling 100km an hour across the continent before pitching to a panel of top industry figures at LeWeb.\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to test their skills against Europe\u2019s best hackers (developers), hustlers (marketeers) and hipsters (designers) while competing for the title of European Champions. In addition to the community that is formed, participants will be exposed to leading tech operations in Europe.\n\n",

This means that independent and small companies like yours are able to implement functionality like Mobile Payments, SMS, Location Based Services using the mobile network, etc\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe most important goal of this meeting is to let the answers of the following questions become almost equal:\n\n-Which API's does the developer want\/need?\n\n-Which API's can KPN provide?\n\nWorkshop KPN likes to implement the API proposition as good as possible to your demands. Therefore, KPN asked SPING (known from Appsterdam Delft Hangout and recent Meet-the-Makers) to advise on the needs from the development community. In order to become acquainted with your technical, functional and business needs and requirements, Sping and creative partner Creatieve Koppen will organize **2 creative sessions**.\n\nDuring the creative sessions we will brainstorm and discuss the types of API\u2019s to be offered, possible combination of services, come up with new mobile concepts and business models.\n\nSo, are you an App-developer or are you advising companies what apps could mean for their business? Do you see the potential of KPN API\u2019s and do you want to participate in this project? It\u2019s a unique chance to influence the choices that are made, get in touch with KPN decisionmakers and a great opportunity to create new business and mobile concepts.\n\nYou can meet up for one of the two sessions:\n\n-First session is November 23 from 1:00pm - 6:00pm.\n\n-Second one is December 2nd from 1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope to see you there!\n\n",

This means that independent and small companies like yours are able to implement functionality like Mobile Payments, SMS, Location Based Services using the mobile network, etc\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe most important goal of this meeting is to let the answers of the following questions become almost equal:\n\n-Which API's does the developer want\/need?\n\n-Which API's can KPN provide?\n\nWorkshop KPN likes to implement the API proposition as good as possible to your demands. Therefore, KPN asked SPING (known from Appsterdam Delft Hangout and recent Meet-the-Makers) to advise on the needs from the development community. In order to become acquainted with your technical, functional and business needs and requirements, Sping and creative partner Creatieve Koppen will organize **2 creative sessions**.\n\nDuring the creative sessions we will brainstorm and discuss the types of API\u2019s to be offered, possible combination of services, come up with new mobile concepts and business models.\n\nSo, are you an App-developer or are you advising companies what apps could mean for their business? Do you see the potential of KPN API\u2019s and do you want to participate in this project? It\u2019s a unique chance to influence the choices that are made, get in touch with KPN decisionmakers and a great opportunity to create new business and mobile concepts.\n\nYou can meet up for one of the two sessions:\n\n-First session is November 23 from 1:00pm - 6:00pm.\n\n-Second one is December 2nd from 1:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n\u00a0\n\nHope to see you there!\n\n",

When our families get to know each other, they will be able to build their own community, and their own support network....Getting to know each other\u2019s families will also help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\"\n\nEveryone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.\n\nBecause our last game day was so much fun, this weekend for the second time, we are inviting you to bring out your favorite board games, card games, iPad games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks and snacks to share.\n\nGame Day will be at the Appsterdam Hangout at NDSM werf.\n\nFrom Appsterdam: Take the NDSM ferry which leaves from the left dock behind Amsterdam Centraal. When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make an immediate right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right, walk past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see the Hangout is in a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left. If you get lost, please call Merel at [masked]\n\nHope to see you there!\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/2\/4\/event_63447172.jpeg\" \/>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/a\/3\/event_42029091.jpeg\" \/>\n\n",

There is a very easy-to-use tool to structure your ideas and plot them on a so-called [Business Model Canvas](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business_Model_Canvas).\n\nSteven Zwerink (@szwerink) will facilitate a workshop where you will learn how to use this simple model for every new business idea. In an inspiring and creative session he will show you how you can use these models to create a business model for your ideas in less than fifteen minutes.\n\nDuring this session you have the chance to create your own business model, share your new ideas with group of friendly Appsterdamrs and learn from Steven and each other. This way when the business model question comes you can answer it with confidence. See you all the 29th of October!\n\nAgenda:\n\n12:00 - Doors open, coffee, lunch, gathering\n\n13:00 - Workshop begins\n\n17:00 - Pizza and beer!\n\nWe ask a \u20ac20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food.

                "description": "Appsterdam Family Weekends are a time for all Appsterdammers to get together in an informal way, outside of the bar meetups, where people of all ages are welcome. As Mike wrote in his [blog](http:\/\/mur.mu.rs\/?p=239):\n\n\"...it\u2019s important not just to get the nerds together, but also to get our families together. When our families get to know each other, they will be able to build their own community, and their own support network....Getting to know each other\u2019s families will also help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community.\"\n\nEveryone is welcome to attend: you, your colleagues, children, partners, parents, grandparents.. EVERYONE! In the past, we've visited the Artis Zoo, NEMO Science Center, De Hortus Botanicus, and more.\n\nThis weekend, we are inviting you to our NDSM hangout and bring out your favorite board games, card games, iPad games, ANY games, so we can all have fun just playing games! We'll provide some beverages, but feel free to bring more drinks and snacks to share.\n\nGame Day will be at the Appsterdam Hangout at NDSM werf.\n\nFrom Appsterdam: Take the NDSM ferry which leaves from the left dock behind Amsterdam Centraal. When you get off the ferry at NDSM-werf, make an immediate right onto Ms. van Riemsdijkweg. The Pannenkoeken boat will be on your right, walk past that, down the street, and make your first left onto Tt. Neveritaweg. Walk about 100 m and you'll see the Hangout is in a fenced lot on the right with some large piles of rubble in it. Go through the chainlink gate and you'll see the blue buildings towards the water. Our door is on the left. If you get lost, please call Judy at [masked].\n\nHope to see you there!\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/6\/a\/2\/4\/event_63447172.jpeg\" \/>\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n<img src=\"http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/1\/a\/3\/event_42029091.jpeg\" \/>\n\n",

                "description": "Appsterdam\u00a0Guru\u00a0Sessions are informal, very hands-on workshops to share a technology or a technique between developers. Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\nOn October 15 we will give a hands-on Android session at the great Mediamatic location. It's meant for people who haven't learned Android, or haven't really \"flexed their muscles\" with it yet. We'll teach you in the way developers learn best: First we make sure you have the basic concepts at your fingertips, then we throw you in the deep end of the pool! That means you'll team up, pick an idea and start\u00a0building\u00a0an app, learning with your team while being supported by the facilitators. And best of all, we'll round off the afternoon with pizza and beer.\n\nHosts: Raul Portales of\u00a0[Pilltree](http:\/\/thepilltree.com\/web\/index.php), Ronald van der Lingen of\u00a0[Layar](http:\/\/www.layar.com\/), Matt Feigal\n\nAssistant Android Angels: Tony Atkins of Atlassian, Magnus Dahl\n\nAgenda:\n\n9:30 - 10:00 - Doors open, developers gather, coffee, environment check\n\n10:00 - 12:00 - Getting started: Hands-on introduction to Android\n\n12:00 - 17:00 - Lunch, \"Hackathon\" style guided learning with a team\n\n17:00 - Pizza and beer!\n\nThis session is targeted at developers. No Android experience necessary, but you should be comfortable with Java (or at least not afraid of it). You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed and ready:\u00a0[Java 7 SE JDK](http:\/\/www.oracle.com\/technetwork\/java\/javase\/downloads\/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html),\u00a0[Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/downloads\/),\u00a0[Android SDK release 13](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/index.html), and the\u00a0[ADT Plugin for Eclipse](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/eclipse-adt.html). Whew! Here's a\u00a0[pretty good guide](http:\/\/developer.android.com\/sdk\/installing.html)\u00a0if you get lost.\n\nWe ask a \u20ac20 registration fee (payable onsite) to cover expenses and food. Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the\u00a0session.\n\n(NOTE: Because we got two new assistants, we opened a few more spots to RSVP - you can find the \"bonus\" by [RSVPing at the Mediamatic website](http:\/\/www.mediamatic.net\/page\/230719\/en))\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

Explanation from your peers, open discussion and practical experience are key to these sessions.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOn July 28 we will focus on a programming \"meta\" topic, a practice called Test Driven Development. TDD gives courage and leads to clean code and iterative design. In this workshop we will start with hands-on exercises of TDD, explain the benefits of this practice, and dive into some of the deeper challenges found in real life.\u00a0\n\nWhile the techniques apply to nearly all programming languages, for this session we will use Objective-C and MacRuby to illustrate our points and tackle some of the challenges of applying TDD to Objective-C. If you don't have a Mac, or are not an Objective-C programmer, please tell us that when you sign up. We will pair you up with someone for the hands-on exercises.\n\nWe ask a \u20ac20 registration fee to cover expenses and food. You will need to bring a Mac (or pair up with a peer), with the following software installed and ready: Xcode (available cheap from the Mac Appstore) and [MacRuby 0.10 or 0.11.](http:\/\/www.macruby.org\/downloads.html) Space is limited to 20 people, so please notify us if you need to cancel before the session.\n\nThis event is being sponsored by ** [Apps for Noord-Holland](http:\/\/appsfornoordholland.nl) **.\n\n",
