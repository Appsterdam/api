No talks are ever scheduled and everyone is always welcome to join.\r\n\r\nBe sure to ask the waitress\/waiter about their seasonal beers and grab a snack to share with your friends. All Appsterdammers get 10% off the entire bill, so order whatever you want to eat\/drink. Then sit back and enjoy the company of your peers.\r\n\r\nThe day is always Wednesday. The place is always Caf\u00e9 Bax (http:\/\/www.cafebax.nl\/). The time, for now, is 19:00.\r\n\r\nPlease note: It's a very casual event so people often don't RSVP or show up exactly on time.

Appsterdammer Fellow James Bennett is a software engineer and mobile app developer make who will introduce you to the basics of Flutter.\r\n\r\nJoin us for beer, pizza and basic Flutter coding!\r\n\r\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\r\n\r\n**Session Overview**\r\n\r\nThis presentation is a shortcut to building cross-platform Flutter apps: iOS, Android, web, and even desktop! You've probably built UI and made API calls before, so how is this best done in Flutter?\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss the motivations for using Flutter over its competitors. We'll show what the developer needs to know about how it works. Then there will be a step by step coding walk-through, which shows how to avoid common mistakes.\r\n\r\nBy the end, you'll have a full understanding of how one codebase can be written for an excellent user experience on all platforms, along with best practices for state management and networking. You'll also have access to the codebase of the performant sample app we'll create. You'll have what's needed to build Flutter projects elegantly.",
